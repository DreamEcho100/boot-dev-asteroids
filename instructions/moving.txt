Moving
Now instead of rotating, we need the ship to move back and forth with the W and S keys.

Assignment
Create a new constant in constants.py to represent the player speed. I named mine PLAYER_SPEED, and gave it a value of 200.
Add a new method to the Player class called .move(). It takes one argument: dt. We want to modify the player's position; but first, we need to do a little bit of math.
We start with a unit vector pointing straight up from (0, 0) to (0, 1).
We rotate that vector by the player's rotation, so it's pointing in the direction the player is facing.
We multiply by PLAYER_SPEED * dt. A larger vector means faster movement.
Add the vector to our position to move the player.
Vector Math

This is a course on programming, not vector math, so we've done the math for you. All those words boil down to these two lines of code:

forward = pygame.Vector2(0, 1).rotate(self.rotation)
self.position += forward * PLAYER_SPEED * dt

Modify the update method in the Player class to call the move method when the W or S keys are pressed.
Run the game. You should now be able to fly around the screen with the W, A, S, and D keys!
